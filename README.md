This is a simple web scraper that helped me better understand html more. The idea was to be able to compare the price of a product across various websites.
Due to these websites consistently making changes to their structures, paired with having zero intentions of violating any terms of service, I probably won't be playing around with this one too often. It was a good exercise in html.
